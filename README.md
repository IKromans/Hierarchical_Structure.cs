# Hierarchical_Structure.cs

Hey! Welcome to my application that can determine levels of hierarchical structure.

Code is in C#. For Tests I used xUnit 2.4.1.

To run application:

> clone this repository `https://github.com/IKromans/Hierarchical_Structure.cs.git`

> navigate to folder where RecursionExercise.cs is located. Open terminal and run command `csc RecursionExercise.cs Branch.cs CountBranches.cs`, this will create a `RecursionExercise.exe` that you can run it from terminal by typing `RecursionExercise.exe`.

> the application will run and display text with structure levels counted. For this structure answer will be:

You can try and add some structure to see results.

To run tests:

> navigate to test folder, open terminal and type `dotnet test`, and wait for results.

Enjoy!
